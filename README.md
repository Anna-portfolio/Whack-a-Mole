# Whack-a-Mole
An arcade game using HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript

Main features:
- three boxes (start, game, and result);
- JavaScript: switching between the above boxes, time and result containers, a random time of mole's peep (between .2s and 1s), moles hide when hit,
- additional visual and sound effects when hiting the mole (four different sounds);
- other visual effects: a hammer-cursor and on-hover animated buttons;
- responsive design.

INFO: All the images and sounds created by @Anna-portfolio 
(No moles were harmed during sound recording :))
